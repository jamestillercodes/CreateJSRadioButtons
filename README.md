# CreateJSRadioButtons
Helper classes for creating RadioButtons and CheckBoxes in CreateJS/EaselJS 

These are used in pretty much the same way as the ButtonHelper class, with a few exceptions.
There are now 6 state params instead of 3, which are exactly the same as ButtonHelper's out, over, down states, but they've been doubled to handle true/false behavior.
